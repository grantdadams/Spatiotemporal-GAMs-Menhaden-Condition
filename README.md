# Spatiotemporal-GAMs-Menhaden-Condition
Analysis from Adams, G. D., Leaf, R. T., Wu, W., & Hernandez, F. J. (2018). Environmentally driven fluctuations in condition factor of adult Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus) in the northern Gulf of Mexico. ICES Journal of Marine Science, 75(4), 1269-1279.


We evaluated the effects of multiple bottom-up processes on the relative condition (an index of length-specific weight) of adult Gulf menhaden Brevoortia patronus sampled from the US commercial fishery, from 1964 to 2011, in the northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM). A series of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) were constructed to evaluate replationships between relative condition and Mississippi River Discharge (MRD), El Nino Southern ~ Oscillation (ENSO), wind vector components, sea surface temperature (SST), and chlorophyll a concentration.
